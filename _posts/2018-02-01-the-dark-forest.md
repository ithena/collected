The reason the title is “[The Dark Forest](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Forest-Remembrance-Earths-Past/dp/0765386690)” in itself makes it worthwile reading. 

I also really like to read [The Three Body Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1517521347&sr=1-1), book 1 in the “Remembrance of Earth's Past” series.
